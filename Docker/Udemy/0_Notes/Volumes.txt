Anonumous Volumes are managed by Docker
    - Need to define in Dockerfile with a path inside of a container
    - NOT persistent (if conter is deleted - volume is also deleted)
    - Usecases:
        - TBD

Named Volumes are managed by Docker
    - Created 
    - persistent (if container is deleted - volume will NOT be deleted)
    - Usecases:
        - Think of EFS (shared across all containers)

# Docker Volume Example

docker container run -d -p 8000:80 \
--name feedback-app-container \
--rm \
-v feedback:/app/feedback \         # This is a Named Volume (persistent)
