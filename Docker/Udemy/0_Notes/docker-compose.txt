--rm is applied to all containers defined in the docker-compose file
all container will be part of the same network by default
    So, no need to do it ourselves; however, can be managed by us as well


----- Commands ----

docker compose up
docker compose up -d            # in detached mode
docker compose down             # will automatically delete all container (same as --rm)
docker compose down -v          #
