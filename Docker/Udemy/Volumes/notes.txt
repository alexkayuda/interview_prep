# General Notes:

temp folder     -> files that can be lost. Therefore, will be stored inside a container only. 
feedback folder -> files that can NOT be lost. Therefore, we need a persistent storage (Volumes)

# Docker Commands:
docker image build -t feedback-app-image:volume .

# docker container run -d -p 8000:80 --name feedback-app-container --rm feedback-app-image:volume
docker container run -d -p 8000:80 --name feedback-app-container -- rm -v feedback:/app/feedback feedback-app-image:volume

docker container run -d -p 8000:80 \
--name feedback-app-container \
--rm \
-v feedback:/app/feedback \
-v $(pwd):/app:ro  \
feedback-app-image:volume
# NOTE -v $(pwd):/app:ro   <- :ro = Read Only

docker container stop feedback-app-container

docker container prune
docker image prune

-----

# Docker Volumes

docker volume ls
docker volume feedback inspect
docker volume prune

Anonumous Volumes are managed by Docker
    - Need to define in Dockerfile with a path inside of a container
    - NOT persistent (if conter is deleted - volume is also deleted)
    - Usecases:
        - TBD

Named Volumes are managed by Docker
    - Created 
    - persistent (if container is deleted - volume will NOT be deleted)
    - Usecases:
        - Think of EFS (shared across all containers)
