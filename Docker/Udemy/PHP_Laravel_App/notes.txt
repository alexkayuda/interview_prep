Step 1: docker-compose.yaml file

Step 2:

    Individually start a COMPOSER container 

    docker-compose run --rm composer create-project --prefer-dist --no-dev laravel/laravel .

    Note 1: `up` command has built-in --rm flag; however, `run` does not. Therefore, we are adding `--rm` to keep it clean
    Note 2: ENTRYPOINT is defined in the COMPOSE dockerfile. it will append `composer --ignore-platform-reqs` to every command ran inside 
    Note 3: `.` points to the WORKDIR specified in the Dockerfile  


Step 3:

    Start all 3 services (server, mysql, and php)

    docker-compose up -d --build server

    Note 1: because server depends on mysql and php, ALL 3 will be UP!


Step 4:

    Test Database Connection

    docker compose run --rm artisan migrate
