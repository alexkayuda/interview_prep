## Categories

- Technical Controls
  - involves hardware and software systems specifically designed to monitor and control the network's security
    - Example: Setting up a network intrusion detection system
- Managerial / Administrative Controls
  - involves the strategic planning and governance side of security
    - Example: Implementing a risk identification tool
- Operational Controls
  - primarily human-centric and focus on procedures and responsibilities
    - Example: Employee Cybersecurity Training
- Physical Controls
  - manage access to premises and hardware
  - incurring higher implementation and maintenance costs compared to technical controls
    - Example: Installing a building access control system

## Control types

- Preventive Controls
  - Proactive measures implemented to thwart potential security threats or breaches
    - Example: system password and physical door lock
- Deterrent Controls
  - Discourage potential attackers by making the effort seem less appealing or more challenging
    - Example: a warning sign indicating cameras are in use
- Detective Controls
  - Monitor and alert organizations to malicious activities as they occur or shortly thereafter
    - Example: A security camera system
- Corrective Controls
  - Mitigate any potential damage and restore our systems to their normal state
    - Example: Antivirus software
    - Example: Automatically restart services after it has detected the system has crashed
- Compensating Controls
  - Alternative measures that are implemented when primary security controls are not feasible or effective
    - Example: restores the functionality of systems via alternative methods, such as using a backup
- Directive Controls
  - Guide, inform, or mandate actions
  - Often rooted in policy or documentation and set the standards for behavior within an organization
