# Compare and contrast security implications of different architecture models

<br>

## Important to Remember

- Cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness
- On-premise solutions provide control and security but can be expensive and challenging to maintain
- Hybrid solutions offer flexibility and control but require considerations of security, compliance, interoperability, and cost

### Architecture and infrastructure concepts

- Cloud Computing
  - Responsibility matrix
  - Hybrid considerations
  - Third-party vendors
    - Provides specialized services to enhance functionality, security, and efficiency of cloud solutions
- High availability
- Infrastructure as code (IaC)
  - Software-driven setup instead of manual configuration
- Serverless
  - Cloud provider manages server allocation
  - Developers focus solely on writing code
- Microservices
- Network infrastructure
  - Physical isolation
    - Air-gapped
  - Logical segmentation
  - Software-defined networking (SDN)
    - Dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration
    - Improves network performance and monitoring
- On-premises
- Centralized vs. decentralized
- Containerization
  - Lightweight alternative, encapsulating apps with their OS environment
- Virtualization
  - Emulates servers, each with its own OS within a virtual machine
- IoT
  - Network of physical devices with sensors and connecti
- Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
  - Systems used to monitor and control industrial processes, found in various industries like water, oil, gas, data.
  - Distributed Control Systems (DCS)
    - Used in control production systems within a single location
  - Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)
    - Used to control specific processes such as assembly lines and factories
- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
  - Type of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) designed for monitoring and controlling <b> geographically dispersed </b> industrial processes
- Real-time operating system (RTOS)
  - Critical for time-sensitive applications like flight navigation and medical equipment
- Embedded systems
  - Specialized computing components designed for dedicated functions within larger devices

### Considerations

- Availability
  - System's ability to be accessed when needed
- Resilience
  - System's ability to recover from failures
- Cost
  - Consider both upfront and long-term costs
- Responsiveness
  - Speed at which the system can adapt to demand
- Scalability
  - System's ability to handle increased workloads
- Ease of Deployment
  - Cloud services are easier to set up than on-premise solutions
- Risk Transference
  - Some risks are transferred to the provider, but customers are responsible for security
- Ease of recovery
  - Cloud services offer easy data recovery and backup solutions
- Patch availability
  - Providers release patches for vulnerabilities automatically
- Inability to patch
  - Compatibility issues or lack of control can hinder patch
- Power
  - Reduces customer costs and eliminates power management concerns
- Compute
  - Refers to computational resources, including CPUs, memory, and storage
  - Cloud providers offer various compute options to suit different needs
